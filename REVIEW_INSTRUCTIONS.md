{
  "review": {
    "summary": "This is a strong security hardening PR. It effectively addresses supply chain risks by pinning dependencies to immutable commit hashes, adheres to the Principle of Least Privilege by restricting AI agent permissions, and mitigates injection risks in CI workflows. The handling of Fork PRs in the PII scanner is also a welcome improvement for workflow stability.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": ".github/workflows/onefilellm.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Verify URL query parameter compatibility",
      "description": "The strict input validation blocks the `&` character to prevent shell background execution. This is a good security control, but it will break URLs with query parameters (e.g., `?foo=1&bar=2`) unless they are URL-encoded (`%26`). Ensure this limitation is documented or that the `onefilellm` tool expects encoded inputs.",
      "suggestion": "If unencoded URLs are a strict requirement, consider allowing `&` only when it appears part of a valid URL pattern, or strictly quoting the input variable when passing it to the execution context to prevent shell interpretation."

      "title": "Impact of disabling glob expansion",
      "description": "The addition of `set -f` disables shell glob expansion. If users previously relied on passing wildcards (e.g., `src/*.ts`) to be expanded by the shell before reaching the tool, this functionality will now cease unless `onefilellm` performs its own internal globbing.",
      "suggestion": "Verify that `onefilellm` supports internal glob handling, or update documentation to inform users that shell expansion is disabled for security reasons."
