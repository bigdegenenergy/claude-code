{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR removes blocking checks to allow the script to run in more contexts (including inside the source repo) and fixes potential self-copying errors. However, removing the source repository guard clause creates a significant risk for developers working on the toolkit itself, as running the script locally could trigger an update that overwrites uncommitted changes.",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 1,
      "title": "Risk of overwriting local development work",
      "description": "You removed the guard clause that prevented the script from running inside the `ai-dev-toolkit` source repository. If a developer runs `./install.sh` inside their local clone of the toolkit (where `SCRIPT_DIR == GIT_ROOT`), the script presumably falls through to the 'update' logic (fetching from remote). This will overwrite their local uncommitted changes with the remote version, causing data loss.\n\nThe logic fix `[ \"$SCRIPT_DIR\" != \"$GIT_ROOT\" ]` prevents the `cp` command from erroring on source==dest, but it does not prevent the subsequent download/update logic from overwriting the current directory.",
      "suggestion": "Ensure that if `SCRIPT_DIR == GIT_ROOT` (running inside the source repo), the script skips any remote download/update steps and only performs non-destructive setup (like installing hooks). Alternatively, restore a non-blocking warning or check for dirty git status before proceeding."
