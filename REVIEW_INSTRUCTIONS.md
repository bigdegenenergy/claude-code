# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

> Generated by Gemini

```toml
[review]
summary = "This PR introduces functional changes to the AI implementation workflow but includes a generated artifact that should not be merged. Additionally, the documentation in CLAUDE.md contradicts the code changes regarding reaction triggers (which were removed), and there is a logic bug in the local fallback path for the implementation script."
decision = "REQUEST_CHANGES"

title = "Do not merge generated artifacts"
description = "This file appears to be an automatically generated report meant for temporary consumption by the agent. The file content itself explicitly states 'It should not be included in the repository or merged'. Please remove this file from the PR."

line = 1
title = "Documentation contradicts code changes"
description = "The updated `CLAUDE.md` states that users can 'react with 👍 to the prompt'. However, the PR description and workflow changes indicate that reaction detection was removed because it was unreliable. The documentation should reflect that only `/accept` (or `/implement`) commands are supported."
suggestion = "Remove references to 👍 reaction triggers in CLAUDE.md."

title = "Broken default path resolution logic"
description = "The `sdkPath` fallback defaults to `path.join(process.cwd(), 'node_modules', ...)` (which points to the package directory). However, the subsequent usage `path.join(sdkPath, 'node_modules', ...)` expects `sdkPath` to be the installation root (the parent of `node_modules`). If `SDK_PATH` is not set (e.g., during local testing), the script will construct an invalid path like `.../claude-code/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/...` and fail to load the package."
suggestion = "Change the default `sdkPath` to `process.cwd()` (or the expected installation root) to match the path structure assumed by the usage logic."

title = "Redundant SDK installation"
description = "The SDK is installed in `/tmp/claude-sdk` and then immediately installed again in `.github/scripts`. The script explicitly uses `SDK_PATH` (pointing to `/tmp/claude-sdk`) for resolution. The second installation in `.github/scripts` appears unused and slows down the workflow."
suggestion = "Remove the 'Install SDK in script location' step."

title = "Brittle entry point resolution"
description = "Manually parsing `package.json` exports/main fields to find the entry point is fragile and reimplements complex Node.js resolution logic (which may fail on conditional exports). A more robust approach would be to use `createRequire`."
suggestion = "Consider using `module.createRequire(path.join(sdkPath, 'node_modules')).resolve('@anthropic-ai/claude-code')` to rely on Node's native resolution."
