# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

```json
{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR correctly fixes a functional bug in `git checkout` where references were being treated as file paths. However, switching `SOURCE_TAG` from a commit SHA to a git tag introduces a supply chain security risk, as tags are mutable.",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Supply Chain Risk: Use of mutable git tag",
      "description": "The PR updates `SOURCE_TAG` to `v2.3.0` (a git tag) instead of a specific commit SHA. Git tags are mutable and can be moved or hijacked to point to malicious code. For security-sensitive toolkits, dependencies must be pinned to a specific commit hash to guarantee immutability and deterministic installs.",
      "suggestion": "Determine the full commit SHA corresponding to release `v2.3.0` and pin `SOURCE_TAG` to that hash."
    }
