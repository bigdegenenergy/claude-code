  "review": {
    "summary": "This PR correctly addresses the Confused Deputy vulnerability by restricting workflow triggers to trusted users and improves supply chain security by pinning MCP server versions. The workflow syntax fix and artifact cleanup are also verified. However, a likely typo in the pinned version for the filesystem server needs to be corrected to prevent installation failures.",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"

  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "critical",
      "file": ".github/mcp-config.json.template",
      "line": 1,
      "title": "Invalid future-dated package version",
      "description": "The version `2026.1.14` pinned for `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` appears to be a typo (future year). Pinning a non-existent future version will cause the `npx` command to fail during template initialization.",
      "suggestion": "Change `2026.1.14` to the intended version (likely `2025.1.14` or the latest valid release)."
    },

      "title": "Verify Sentry package availability",
      "description": "The configuration migrates the Sentry package to the `@sentry` scope. Ensure that the specific package name used (e.g., `@sentry/mcp-server-sentry`) is published and public on npm, as scope migrations often involve package renaming.",
      "suggestion": "Verify the existence of the package with `npm view @sentry/mcp-server-sentry` (or the specific name used) before merging."
