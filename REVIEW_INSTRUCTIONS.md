# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

{
  "review": {
    "summary": "Security hardening measures are well-implemented, particularly the dependency pinning and read-only agent permissions. However, the command injection prevention logic in the CI workflow is too restrictive and will break valid URL inputs containing standard characters like '&'.",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".github/workflows/onefilellm.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Input validation blocks valid URL characters",
      "description": "The validation regex `[\\$;\\|\\&><\\`\\(\\)]` includes characters commonly found in URLs, specifically the ampersand (`&`) for query parameters and parentheses (`()`). Since `onefilellm` is designed to process URLs, this check will cause valid inputs (e.g., URLs with query strings) to fail validation, causing a regression in functionality.",
      "suggestion": "Remove `&`, `(`, and `)` from the regex blocklist. To prevent command injection securely, ensure the `$INPUT_SOURCES` variable is double-quoted in all subsequent shell usage, rather than sanitizing the input content."
    },

      "id": 2,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Unpinned 'main' branch usage in install script",
      "description": "Setting `SOURCE_TAG=\"main\"` creates a non-deterministic installation target that will break if the main branch becomes unstable. While noted as temporary, this reduces reliability.",
      "suggestion": "Use a specific commit SHA for `SOURCE_TAG` instead of `\"main\"` until the release tag `v2.3.0` is officially created."
