# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

```toml
[review]
summary = "This PR introduces necessary ignore files (`.npmignore`, `.dockerignore`) but also includes a Python utility script that conflicts with the project's Node.js ecosystem and the proposed `.gitignore` rules. I am requesting changes to align the utility script with the project language (TypeScript) and fix the git configuration to prevent potential security risks regarding database files."

line = 1
title = "Contradictory Git Configuration"
description = "You are adding `.claude/scripts/` to `.gitignore` while simultaneously committing a file (`.claude/scripts/user_utils.py`) inside that directory. If this script is shared tooling, the directory should not be ignored. If it is local-only, the file should not be in the PR."
suggestion = "Remove the ignore rule for `.claude/scripts/` if the script is to be tracked, or remove the script from the PR."

line = 1
title = "Tech Stack Inconsistency"
description = "The project is TypeScript/Node.js based. Introducing a Python script for core utilities creates an undocumented dependency on a Python runtime and external libraries (`bcrypt`), which are not managed in `package.json`. This breaks the 'npm install && npm start' workflow."
suggestion = "Re-implement the user utility functionality in TypeScript using `ts-node` and standard npm packages (e.g., `sqlite3`, `bcrypt`)."

file = ".gitignore"
line = 3
title = "Missing Database Exclusion"
description = "The `user_utils.py` script creates and accesses a local `users.db` file. This file is not explicitly ignored in `.gitignore`, creating a high risk of accidentally committing a database containing sensitive credential hashes."
suggestion = "Add `*.db` or `users.db` to `.gitignore`."

line = 60
title = "Excessive Data Exposure"
description = "The `list_users` function executes `SELECT *`, returning all user data including password hashes. This is a security practice violation as it facilitates credential leakage via logs or terminal output."
suggestion = "Update the query to select only safe fields: `SELECT id, username, email FROM users`."
