{
  "review": {
    "summary": "This update significantly expands the scope of the toolkit by synchronizing documentation, tools, and scripts, while refining the configuration policy (opting out of `CLAUDE.md` sync, opting in to workflow sync). The changes are generally sound, but the synchronization logic for workflows carries a risk of accumulating deprecated files, and the new default sync behavior is aggressive.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".github/workflows/sync-claude-config.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Sync logic accumulates deprecated files (Ghost Files)",
      "description": "The workflow uses `cp -r` to sync directories (workflows, docs, scripts) from the upstream source. If a file is renamed or deleted in the upstream toolkit, it will NOT be removed from the downstream repository. For `.github/workflows`, this is particularly risky as it can lead to duplicate CI workflows running simultaneously (e.g., if a workflow is renamed upstream, the local repo will have both the old and new versions).",
      "suggestion": "Implement a cleanup strategy. For directory mirroring, use `rsync --delete` or manually identify and remove files in the destination that no longer exist in the source before committing."
    },

      "file": ".github/workflows/sync-claude-config.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Aggressive default for workflow synchronization",
      "description": "Changing the `sync_github_workflows` input default to `true` shifts the behavior from opt-in to opt-out. Users who have customized their local workflows may unexpectedly receive PRs to revert/overwrite their changes with upstream defaults.",
      "suggestion": "Consider keeping the default as `false` to prevent disruptive PR noise for existing users, or explicitly highlight this behavior change in the release notes and `install.sh` output."
    },

      "id": 3,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Potential missing executable permissions for tools",
      "description": "The `install_tools` function installs new utilities (e.g., `onefilellm`). If these files are scripts or binaries intended for direct execution, simply downloading/copying them might not set the executable bit (`+x`).",
      "suggestion": "Ensure `chmod +x` is applied to executable files within the `tools/` directory, similar to the logic added for `.github/scripts/`."
