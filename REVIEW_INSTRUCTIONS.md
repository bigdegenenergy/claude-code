## Issues to Address

```toml
[review]
summary = "This PR introduces a Python dependency file to a Node.js/TypeScript repository without context or accompanying Python code. Additionally, mandatory procedural checks in the PR description are incomplete."
decision = "REQUEST_CHANGES"

[[issues]]
severity = "important"
file = "requirements.txt"
title = "Ecosystem mismatch (Python file in Node.js repo)"
description = "This project is configured as a Node.js/TypeScript environment. Adding `requirements.txt` (standard for Python/pip) is unexpected without accompanying Python source code or an explanation in the PR description. If this repository is transitioning to a hybrid structure, please verify that standard Python exclusions (e.g., `__pycache__`, `venv`) are added to `.gitignore`."

[[issues]]
severity = "suggestion"
file = "requirements.txt"
title = "Commit of empty placeholder file"
description = "The file appears to be empty (or contains only a newline). It is generally best practice to add configuration files in the same PR as the code that requires them, rather than as standalone empty placeholders, to maintain atomic commit history."

[[issues]]
severity = "important"
file = "PR Description"
title = "Mandatory checklist incomplete"
description = "The 'Source Repository Check' checkbox is unmarked. Please review the linked repository guidelines and acknowledge them before merging, as required by the PR template."
