# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

```toml
[review]
summary = "This PR integrates the Claude Code SDK for automated implementation logic. The reaction-based trigger workaround (piggybacking on comment events) is clever and the security checks (validating actor permissions) are appropriate. However, the PR includes temporary artifacts (`REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) that must be removed, and the workflow retains verbose debug logging. The manual package resolution strategy in the script is brittle but acceptable given the described upstream package issues."

title = "Remove temporary artifact"
description = "The file `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` appears to be an auto-generated artifact from the agent's feedback loop and should not be included in the source control."

title = "Remove verbose debug logging"
description = "The workflow retains verbose debugging commands (`ls -R $SDK_PATH`, `cat ...`) which clutter the CI output."
suggestion = "Remove the file listing and file content printing commands from the 'Run Implementation' step."

line = 30
title = "Brittle manual module resolution"
description = "The script manually parses `package.json` to resolve entry points (`exports`, `main`, `bin`). This is fragile compared to standard Node.js resolution. While necessary if the upstream package is malformed (missing main/exports), it incurs maintenance risk."
suggestion = "Ensure this manual resolution is strictly necessary. If the SDK is properly packaged, setting `NODE_PATH` to include the installation directory should allow standard `import()` to work."

line = 12
title = "Potential failure on non-PR events"
description = "The workflow uses `github.head_ref` for git operations. This variable is empty on `workflow_dispatch` or `push` events, which would cause the `git fetch` command to fail."
suggestion = "If this workflow is triggered by events other than `pull_request`, ensure a fallback (like `github.ref_name`) is used."
