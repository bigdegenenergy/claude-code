{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR successfully updates the installer with version 2.3.0 stats and introduces a necessary update workflow. The addition of guardrails against self-installation and re-installation improves safety. However, the `--update` flag's behavior of silently forcing overwrites poses a risk to user customizations, which should be addressed or clearly communicated.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Potential loss of user configuration with --update",
      "description": "Setting `FORCE_MODE=true` when `--update` is used causes the script to overwrite existing files without prompting. If the toolkit installs configuration files that users are likely to have modified (e.g., workflow files or agent configs), these changes will be destroyed.",
      "suggestion": "Implement a backup mechanism (e.g., copy existing files to `.bak`) before overwriting, or ensure that user-configurable files are not overwritten if they already exist. At a minimum, add a prominent warning in the output."
    },

      "id": 2,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Hardcoded feature statistics",
      "description": "Manually updating feature counts (Slash Commands: 38, Agents: 19, etc.) in the install script for every release creates a maintenance burden and is prone to errors/drift.",
      "suggestion": "Consider removing specific counts from the installer output or fetching them dynamically to decouple the installer script from the toolkit's feature set growth."
