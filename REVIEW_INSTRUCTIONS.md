  "review": {
    "summary": "This PR adds comprehensive agent capabilities (Browser, Zeno, Specialized Skills) and their associated commands. The prompt engineering is robust, defining clear protocols for verification and evidence. The primary concern is the `git add -A` instruction in the autonomous coding loop, which risks committing unintended files.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".claude/skills/ralph-coder/SKILL.md",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Risky `git add -A` in autonomous loop",
      "description": "The Ralph Coder skill explicitly instructs the agent to run `git add -A`. For an autonomous agent, this is dangerous as it will stage all untracked files (including potentially sensitive local files or large artifacts not yet ignored) without discrimination.",
      "suggestion": "Change the instruction to use `git add -u` to stage modified files, and explicitly `git add` new files created by the agent, or instruct the agent to check `git status` for unexpected untracked files before staging."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": ".claude/commands/browser.md",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Missing dependency checks for Playwright",
      "description": "The browser commands generate code requiring `playwright`. If the toolkit is used in a repo without this dependency, the generated code will fail. The `package.json` for the toolkit itself is not updated in this PR.",
      "suggestion": "Update the command prompt to instruct the agent to verify `playwright` is installed or to use `npx` for all execution steps to avoid dependency issues."
    },

      "id": 3,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": ".claude/skills/deslop/SKILL.md",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Ensure clean git state for Deslop",
      "description": "The Deslop skill performs aggressive code deletion. To prevent data loss and ensure easy rollback, the skill should strictly require a clean git working directory before execution.",
      "suggestion": "Add a mandatory pre-flight check to the Deslop skill: 'Verify git working directory is clean before starting'."
