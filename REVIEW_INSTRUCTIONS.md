# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

```json
{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR introduces aggressive auto-update logic that removes user safety checks and simultaneously enables conflicting `UPDATE` and `FORCE` modes. It also includes an artifact file that appears to be unintentional.",
    "decision": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 5,
      "title": "Conflicting installation modes set simultaneously",
      "description": "The script sets both `UPDATE_MODE=true` and `FORCE_MODE=true` when an installation is detected. Typically, `FORCE_MODE` implies a destructive reinstall (rm -rf && clone), while `UPDATE_MODE` implies an in-place update (git pull). Setting both is contradictory; if the directory is wiped by force, the update logic is irrelevant. If it's not wiped, `FORCE_MODE` might be misleading.",
      "suggestion": "Determine the specific intent (clean reinstall vs. in-place update) and set only the appropriate flag. If `FORCE_MODE` is intended to bypass version checks but keep files, verify downstream logic supports this combination."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 3,
      "title": "Removal of safety check for existing installations",
      "description": "Previously, the script aborted if an installation existed, protecting local modifications. The new logic automatically forces an update/reinstall. This could lead to data loss if a user has modified files within the toolkit directory expecting them to persist.",
      "suggestion": "Restore a confirmation prompt or require an explicit argument (like `--auto-update`) to bypass the safety check, rather than defaulting to aggressive updates."
    },

      "description": "The file `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` appears to be a generated report or instruction set for an AI agent and likely should not be committed to the source repository.",
      "suggestion": "Remove `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` from the PR."
