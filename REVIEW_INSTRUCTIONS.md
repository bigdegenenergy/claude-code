{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The transition to generating the MCP configuration at runtime using `jq` is a strong security improvement, effectively preventing shell injection and accidental secret leakage. The logic appears sound, though the use of unpinned `npx` dependencies warrants attention.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".github/workflows/claude.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Pin runtime dependencies in npx commands",
      "description": "The workflow uses `npx` to execute `@anthropics/mcp-server-fetch` and `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` without version constraints. This pulls the latest version on every run, creating a supply chain risk if a malicious version is published, and potentially breaking CI if a breaking change is released.",
      "suggestion": "Pin the package versions in the `jq` arguments (e.g., `npx -y @anthropics/mcp-server-fetch@0.1.0`) to ensure reproducible and secure builds."
    },

      "line": 0,
      "title": "Verify jq filter syntax for hyphenated keys",
      "description": "Ensure the `jq` filter correctly handles the hyphen in `brave-search`. In standard `jq` object construction, keys with special characters must be quoted (e.g., `\"brave-search\": ...`). Unquoted keys with hyphens are interpreted as subtraction operations.",
      "suggestion": "Check that the generated `jq` command quotes the `\"brave-search\"` key to prevent syntax errors during workflow execution."
