  "review": {
    "summary": "While the updates to `install.sh` improve security by preventing flag injection and handling commit SHAs correctly, the changes to `.github/workflows/onefilellm.yml` introduce a critical security regression. The new 'allowlist' regex permits dangerous shell metacharacters that were previously blocked, enabling potential Command Injection.",

  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "critical",
      "file": ".github/workflows/onefilellm.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Critical Command Injection Vulnerability",
      "description": "The new input validation regex `^[...\\$\\&\\'\\(\\)\\*\\;...]` explicitly allows dangerous shell metacharacters including `$`, `;`, `&`, `(`, `)`, and `'`. Allowing `$` is particularly critical as it permits command substitution (e.g., `$(malicious_command)`) if the `source` variable is referenced inside double quotes in the workflow script. The previous logic correctly blocked these characters; this change removes those protections.",
      "suggestion": "Revert the regex validation to strictly exclude shell metacharacters. Specifically remove `\\$`, `\\;`, `\\&`, `\\(`, `\\)`, `\\*`, and `\\'` from the allowed character class. If URLs containing these characters must be supported, they should be URL-encoded (e.g., `%26` instead of `&`)."
