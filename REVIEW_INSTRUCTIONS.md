{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The changes correctly implement a 'local dev' installation mode by detecting the repository root and copying local files, which improves the developer workflow. However, removing the safeguard that blocked execution within the source repository introduces a potential risk if the installation target is misconfigured. The logic for `USE_LOCAL_SOURCE` is sound.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 15,
      "title": "Missing safeguard against installing into source directory",
      "description": "You removed the check that blocked running the script inside the source repository. While this enables local installation, it removes a layer of protection. If `INSTALL_DIR` is accidentally set to the current directory (`PWD` or `SCRIPT_DIR`), the installation logic (likely containing `rm -rf \"$INSTALL_DIR\"`) could wipe the source repository.",
      "suggestion": "Add a check to ensure `\"$INSTALL_DIR\"` is not equal to `\"$SCRIPT_DIR\"` or `\"$PWD\"` before proceeding with the installation."
    },

      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 30,
      "title": "Ensure exclusion of node_modules during local copy",
      "description": "When copying from the local source (`USE_LOCAL_SOURCE=true`), copying the `node_modules` directory can be very slow and may introduce binary incompatibilities if the temporary build directory environment differs.",
      "suggestion": "Ensure the `cp` or `rsync` command explicitly excludes `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.git`."
