<title>Getting Started</title>
<content><heading level="2">Create an account</heading><paragraph>To get started with Crypto APIs services the first thing you need to do is create your account at https://app.cryptoapis.io/login. By creating an account you get access to a personalized Crypto APIs Dashboard, where you can monitor and control your API keys, requests, credits, tokens, exchange accounts, and more.</paragraph><paragraph>You can create your Crypto APIs account manually by adding information to the required fields, or simply use the Social Login provided for Google, GitHub and LinkedIn.</paragraph><paragraph>Please use a valid email address you have access to, in order to be able to receive messages from Crypto APIs needed for user authentication, registration completion and API use.</paragraph><paragraph>Users can also invite Team members by adding their email addresses. Email addresses that already exist as users type "Owner" cannot be invited as Team members.</paragraph><heading level="2">The Dashboard</heading><paragraph>Once you create an account, you get access to a personalized Crypto APIs Dashboard. Through the dashboard is where you can choose and subscribe to a Crypto APIs blockchain product - Blockchain Data, Blockchain Events, Blockchain Tools, Blockchain Automations, or Crypto Market Data APIs.</paragraph><paragraph>From the Dashboard you can:</paragraph><list type="ul"><item>create and manage API keys - for authorization of the API;</item><item>create and manage callback URLs - set URLs for response;</item><item>monitor successful and failed requests, credits, callbacks;</item><item>manage webhooks and tokens;</item></list><paragraph>The Crypto APIs Technical and Best use Documentation is public and available to everyone. Still, support levels for a Crypto APIs product vary depending on your subscription.</paragraph><heading level="2">Authenticate requests</heading><paragraph>To use and make calls to any Crypto APIs product, you must create an API key, in order for your requests to be authenticated.</paragraph><paragraph>An API key is a code unique to the user who generated it. It is used to identify the call to the specific API and track the access to it and its usage. You can generate your API key from within the Crypto APIs dashboard by clicking on the "Create new API key" button. You can generate more than one API key and use a single API key more than once.</paragraph><heading level="2">Pagination in API request</heading><paragraph>The API response uses pagination to break down large result sets into smaller, manageable chunks. Pagination helps optimize performance by limiting the data returned per API request.</paragraph><paragraph>The following pagination parameters are provided in the API response</paragraph><paragraph>Parameter Type Description:</paragraph><list type="ul"><item>limit Integer Specifies the maximum number of records returned per page/request.</item><item>startingAfter String (ID) Indicates the record after which the current set of results starts. Used for fetching subsequent pages.</item><item>hasMore Boolean If true, additional records exist beyond the current set. If false, you've reached the last page.</item><item>nextStartingAfter String (ID) Represents the ID to use as the startingAfter parameter in your next request to fetch the subsequent page of results.</item><item>sortingOrder String Indicates the sorting order of records returned (ascending or descending). How to use pagination effectively:</item></list><paragraph>Perform your initial API request with the desired limit. If hasMore is true, use the value from nextStartingAfter as the startingAfter parameter in your next request. Continue this process until hasMore returns false, indicating all records have been fetched.</paragraph><paragraph>Example Workflow:</paragraph><paragraph>Request 1</paragraph><paragraph>`GET /endpoint?limit=10``</paragraph><paragraph>Response includes:</paragraph><code language="javascript">{
  "limit": 10,
  "startingAfter": "5ca21f92cf5431000105d1a7",
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextStartingAfter": "5ca21f92cf5431000105d1a7",
  "sortingOrder": "ascending"
}</code><paragraph>Request 2 (using pagination):</paragraph><code language="javascript">GET /endpoint?limit=50&startingAfter=5ca21f92cf5431000105d1a7</code><paragraph>Repeat until hasMore is false.</paragraph></content>

<title>Authentication</title>
<content><heading level="2">Create API key</heading><paragraph>API keys are required as an authentication method with Crypto APIs products. By using an API key you authenticate access to the specific API. Without authentication access to the API is denied.</paragraph><paragraph>You can generate and manage API keys from within the Crypto APIs Dashboard. By clicking on "Create new API key" you can enter a name and the system will generate a unique for your user key for API authentication. Multiple keys can be generated. Old API keys, that you no longer want to use, can be disabled from the same location.</paragraph><heading level="2">Use API key</heading><paragraph>API keys are required for the authentication of the calling program to the API. All Crypto APIs keys use the same base URL "https://rest.cryptoapis.io". They can be used in test environments such as: Development, QA, and main Production environments.</paragraph><paragraph>We do not recommend using the same API key for more than one environment. We do recommend to use a single key for one specific environment - Testing, Production, etc. The API key is sensitive private information that we strongly advise to have and keep restricted access to it.</paragraph><paragraph>Content-Type: application/json X-API-Key: my-api-key</paragraph><paragraph>It's important to secure your API Key against public access. The custom header option is strongly recommended for a production environment.</paragraph></content>

<title>Data Flow Limiting</title>
<content><heading level="2">Data Limiting</heading><paragraph>Data limiting serves three different purposes - it prevents any potential overloading events of the APIs in one way or another; it ensures the best available processing speed and response time on the performed requests; and it provides additional security to Crypto APIs products and the fetched data. Despite its name, the multi-layered functionality of data limiting significantly improves API operations and enhances user experience.</paragraph><paragraph>Data limiting varies based on the subscription tier of the Crypto APIs product you have as a customer. For detailed information on Crypto APIs products and the varying levels of data flow limitations across subscription plans, please visit website.</paragraph><paragraph>Crypto APIs uses the following methods and strategies of limiting data flow:</paragraph><heading level="3">Rate(Throughput) Limiting</heading><paragraph>API rate limiting sets limits on the number of credits that can be spent within a certain period of time along with relevant actions that can be taken. This allows ensuring the stability and performance of an API system. These limits are essential for internet security intended to - prevent DDoS and brute force attacks; prevent the overload of an API; and protect its business value from decreasing. The process essentially restricts simultaneous API calls sent with your API key from a single source, as unlimited calls could compromise both the performance and security of the API in question. Additionally, API limiting aids in enhancing the API's scalability, mitigating lags during traffic spikes.</paragraph><paragraph>For various reasons, the professional service provided by Crypto APIs is subject to API call Rate Limits. These limits, tailored to your usage, are determined by the subscription plan tier you choose. If you wish to increase your Rate limits, feel free to reach out to our team at [email protected] to set up a custom subscription.</paragraph><paragraph>Two different throughput limits associated with different credit per second limits exist:</paragraph><paragraph>Throughput Soft Limit (6,000 credits/sec) is the recommended threshold for data processing or transfer. Usage within this limit is billed at the base rate per credit. Throughput Hard Limit (12,000 credits/second) represents the maximum allowed throughput. Usage that exceeds the Throughput Soft Limit but remains within the Throughput Hard Limit will be billed at a rate slightly higher than the base rate. Exceeding the Throughput Hard Limit will result in a service interruption. Cost Penalty for Exceeding the Soft Limit Cost penalty is applied when the Throughput Soft Limit is exceeded but data processing and credit consumption limits remain within the Throughput Hard Limit. The cost penalty is calculated through a Cost Multiplier based on your active subscription plan.</paragraph><paragraph>Example within Throughput Soft Limit (6,000 credits/second): If 100 credits per second are consumed, this usage falls within the 6,000 credits per second soft limit. Therefore, clients are charged the base rate for each of the 100 credits, which costs a total cost of 100 credits.</paragraph><paragraph>Example within Throughput Hard Limit (12,000 credits/ second): In a scenario in which 8,000 credits per second are used, the usage is within Throughput Hard Limit, but it is exceeding the Throughput Soft Limit. Therefore, each of the credits consumed will be multiplied by the x1.3 cost penalty multiplier. Thus, 8,000 x 1.3 = 10,400 total credit cost.</paragraph><table><thead><tr><th>Subscription Plan</th><th>Soft/Hard Throughput limit</th><th>Credits cost increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Starter</td><td>3000/6000</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Scale</td><td>6000/12000</td><td>1.5</td></tr><tr><td>Pro</td><td>12000/24000</td><td>1.0</td></tr></tbody></table><paragraph>In case you exceed the aforementioned limits, your requests will return an HTTPS Status Code 429.</paragraph><heading level="3">Monthly credits</heading><paragraph>Monthly credits is the total limit of credits included in the subscription plan which users can spend on different API calls, monitoring and operational activities. The monthly credit limit represents the credits accessible to a user.</paragraph><paragraph>Please be aware that you are allowed to purchase additional credits if you reach your credit limit. Monthly credit limit is not equal to the total number of credits that can be used. We have implemented this mechanism to assist you in advancing your projects and to remove any barriers that may be delaying or stopping the progress of your business - refer to "Pay as you Go" section for more information.</paragraph><paragraph>The chosen subscription tier of Crypto APIs products determines the amount of monthly credits allocated to a client, corresponding to their selected plan. Selecting higher-tier subscription plans provides clients with more credits which come at better rates.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that one credit does not correspond with the execution of a single request. Credit charges vary for every endpoint with pricing information made available at the bottom of the page with endpoints' example response attributes. For further information on credit charges for each single endpoint, please, navigate to our Documentation, open the endpoint of concern and scroll to the bottom of the page.</paragraph><paragraph>There are two charge types: "Request" and "List", where the latter is only for endpoints that can list multiple results and have pagination applied.</paragraph><list type="ol"><item>The "Request" type charges a specific amount of credits per a single request. For different endpoints this could be a different amount, but most often it is 500 credits per 1 request. (The charging type can be different for the different endpoints)</item><item>The "List" type charges a certain amount of credits per a specific count of results. Depending on the specific List endpoint this could vary, e.g. a more complex "List" endpoint could charge "100 credits per every result in the response".</item></list><heading level="3">Pay As You Go</heading><paragraph>Crypto APIs employs a fair and transparent pricing model, enabling customers to pay solely for the services they use. This model is applicable across all paid subscription plans, meaning that users must be subscribed to an available paid plan of their choice prior to taking advantage of pay as you go.</paragraph><paragraph>The primary aim of pay-as-you-go is to eliminate any potential barriers present in subscription plans that could hinder our clients' businesses. Rather than being strictly limited to predetermined credit amounts in subscription plans, we enable clients to continue using the services they need without limitations.</paragraph><paragraph>Once users reach and surpass the daily credits specified in their chosen subscription plan, they will automatically continue to use Crypto APIs services as part of our pay-as-you-go schema. When exceeding the credits of their subscription plans, users will be required to cover the cost of all additional credits for executing all extra API calls that they have made. The pricing for pay-as-you-go credits is determined by the active subscription plan chosen by the customer.</paragraph><paragraph>As part of the pay-as-you-go model, we introduced different automatic withdrawal limits which correspond with the user's usage. These limits are triggered when specific levels (levels = additional value of services on top of the subscription plan) are reached. For example, when reaching an X amount of additional credits, the automatic withdrawal rule will be enforced for the first time and customers will be automatically charged with the corresponding payable amount. If users continue to use our services beyond that point, the next value limit will be reached afterwards which will trigger the automatic funds withdrawal mechanism for a second time.</paragraph><paragraph>To get information on the extra value/credit tiers and their thresholds, please contact us at [email protected].</paragraph><heading level="3">Charging structure</heading><paragraph>The pricing structure should offer clarity on how the credit-based model operates within the Crypto APIs suite. Most activities have a more simple structure and are easier to understand. However, some of the APIs work in a more specific way as each of these APIs is divided into a set of activities. Each of them incurs a specific credit cost and has a different weight in the overall pricing.</paragraph><heading level="4">xPub</heading><paragraph>Synchronizing an xPub enables the synchronization of all historical transactions and addresses within an Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, providing access to data as needed. There are four primary activities associated with xPub synchronization, each incurring different costs:</paragraph><table><thead><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Definition</th><th>Credits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>xPub synchronization</td><td>Initiate synchronization through the API.</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>xPub monitoring</td><td>Daily monitoring per derived address.</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>xPub transaction / operations</td><td>Initiate synchronization through the API.</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Delete synced xPub</td><td>Remove further synchronization through the API.</td><td>500</td></tr></tbody></table><heading level="4">Synced address</heading><paragraph>The address synchronization API functions similarly, with nearly identical actions permitted. It enables verifying historical transaction data associated with the synchronized address. It's important to note that while you can access data from the past 14 days without synchronization, the synchronization itself is necessary for retrieving older data. The actions that are allowed through the address API are:</paragraph><table><thead><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Definition</th><th>Credits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Address synchronization</td><td>Initiate synchronization through the API.</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Address monitoring</td><td>Daily monitoring of the address.</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Address Webhooks</td><td>Receive callback notifications (upon completion of the initial synchronization).</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Delete synced address</td><td>Remove further synchronization through the API.</td><td>400</td></tr></tbody></table><heading level="4">Blockchain events</heading><paragraph>When it comes to webhook live events, clients can monitor on-chain activities for specific events such as new block creation, new transactions, token transfers, internal transactions, and beyond. The webhook live events API facilitates the execution of four key activities:</paragraph><table><thead><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Definition</th><th>Credits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Create Event</td><td>Creating and subscribing to a particular event of interest for the client through the API.</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Event monitoring (per day)</td><td>Daily monitoring of the active event.</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Event operations (per callback)</td><td>Handling activities associated with the specific blockchain event.</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Delete Event</td><td>Remove future webhook notifications through the API.</td><td>400</td></tr></tbody></table><paragraph>The credit pricing is subject to change. We advise you to regularly review</paragraph><paragraph>details to ensure accurate project budgeting and cost management.</paragraph></content>

The following information may be subject to change and may as well not apply to other software.</paragraph><paragraph>We use OpenAPI 3 Standard for our Technical Documentation and Endpoints description. All Technical Documentation can be found in the Developer's Portal. Moreover, all Crypto APIs are REST.</paragraph><heading level="2">URI</heading><heading level="3">URI Structure</heading><paragraph>The Crypto APIs and endpoint URIs follow the RFC 3986 specification and are divided into three main parts, applicable to all Crypto APIs products (Blockchain Events, Blockchain Data, etc.):</paragraph><list type="ol"><item>The domain and subdomain in the URI always display as: rest.cryptoapis.io</item><item>Next is displayed the product name, where words are separated with spinal-case: /blockchain-data/</item></list><paragraph>Example:</paragraph><paragraph>rest.cryptoapis.io/blockchain-data/..</paragraph><paragraph>Depending on which product is specified, after that the URI's structure may look different in each case.

<title>Callbacks</title>
<content><heading level="2">Callbacks and Main Terminology</heading><paragraph>Let's first define some main vocabulary related to callbacks that will make the process easier to talk about.</paragraph><heading level="3">Callback</heading><paragraph>Shortly put, a "callback" is a POST request sent from Crypto APIs to a customer's Callback URL when an event they have already subscribed for occurs.</paragraph><paragraph>Now with a bit more detail, a "callback" is used to describe an event reaction process where a user receives notifications on certain events by having first subscribed to them in the system. The term has become interchangeable with the word "webhook", used to describe the same thing. The callback is a way for the system to avoid customers constantly calling the Crypto API to check for an update or event they may be expecting. Callbacks can be very useful for customers who expect, track or want to be notified about the state of transactions on the blockchain.</paragraph><paragraph>There are two sides of the callback - the server side and the customer side. The process follows the customer side subscribing for an event on the server side and the server side notifying the customer side when that event is completed.</paragraph><paragraph>With Crypto APIs there are endpoints which will lead to callbacks. These include, but are not limited to Blockchain Events.</paragraph><heading level="3">Callback Events</heading><heading level="4">Definition</heading><paragraph>Specific processes are considered an "event". Simply put, an "event" is something that occurs on the Blockchain or Crypto Market. Crypto APIs incorporates various endpoints which hold different characteristics. You can see endpoints that represent events to which users can subscribe for a callback on our API Reference page. Such supported for callback endpoints are displayed with an arrow icon next to them to easily view Callback request parameters and response examples.</paragraph><heading level="4">Types</heading><paragraph>There are a number of different event types. As a Callback event the following are considered:</paragraph><list type="ul"><item>New Block;</item><item>New Incoming Transaction;</item><item>New Outgoing Transaction;</item><item>New Confirmation;</item><item>Already Forwarded Coins, and more.</item></list><heading level="3">Callback URL</heading><paragraph>Callbacks require what is known as a "Callback URL". It is the destination where Crypto APIs sends the callback notification for the event. Setting up this URL is done entirely on the customer's side and is the first step to setting up a Callback.</paragraph><paragraph>Let's see the main step the customer needs to take in order to set up their Callback URL:</paragraph><paragraph>First and foremost, the user must verify a domain they have access to in general. This is done in their Crypto APIs Dashboard.</paragraph><paragraph>After the domain is verified, then the user can set a specific URL destination to serve as the Callback URL.</paragraph><paragraph>Example:</paragraph><paragraph>Domain to verify: "mypage.mydomain.com" Callback URL to set: "mypage.mydomain.com/login/callback" Cannot use URL: "mydomain.com/login/callback"</paragraph><paragraph>Domain to verify: "mydomain.com" Callback URL to set: "mydomain.com/login/callback" Cannot use URL: "mypage.mydomain.com/login/callback"</paragraph><paragraph>It is most important that the user has access to the Callback URL they set, in order for them to be able to access/see the callback notification when received.</paragraph><heading level="2">Crypto APIs Callback basics</heading><paragraph>Crypto APIs Callbacks follow certain basics and the same standard that applies to all callback subscriptions.</paragraph><list type="ul"><item>Callback requests sent from Crypto APIs are always POST;</item><item>All Crypto APIs headers must by default incorporate the JSON content type application/json;</item><item>All Crypto API Callbacks incorporate the use of a Callback URL, without exceptions;</item><item>A customer can subscribe for a callback to as many supported events as they want, as many times as needed;</item><item>The callback functionality in Crypto APIs is identical throughout every product and endpoint that supports it;</item><item>The callback request from Crypto APIs to the customer includes the exact information and parameters as requested by the customer when they first set up the subscription, which are included in the data parameter of the code;</item><item>The attribute x-signature is a custom for Crypto APIs parameter, as indicated with the x- in the beginning;</item><item>The structure of the Callback is always the same no matter the subscription or type of event.</item></list><heading level="2">Callback standard structure</heading><paragraph>The callback structure has the following constant parameters:</paragraph><code language="javascript">{
    "apiVersion": "2.0", //**Represents the current Crypto APIa version**
    "referenceId": "2921e3df-c671-4d20-b51b-d176d5c1e43g", //**Represents the unique reference identifier of the callback.**
    "idempotencyKey": "3b3359d0ccdb1d3d3ca8dbaa79cb5395b33c5bc52d782f3ea22904abef45d1j4", //**Specifies a unique ID used by Crypto APIs to recognize consecutive requests with the same data so that not to perform the same operation twice.**
    "data": { //**Includes information and details on the callback, dependent on the customer’s secret.**
        "product": "BLOCKCHAIN_EVENTS", //**Specifies the product for which the event occurs.**
        "event": "BLOCK_MINED", //**Specifies the actual event type, for which the callback subscription was made.
        "item": { //**Includes all customer-specific details for the callback.**
        }
    }
}</code><heading level="3">Reference ID and referenceId</heading><paragraph>The referenceId indicates a reference to the subscription that has been made by the customer. It is a unique code applicable only for that subscription. Each time a customer sets up an automation or event subscription, the corresponding callback always has a parameter referenceId.</paragraph><heading level="3">Idempotency and idempotentKey</heading><paragraph>Idempotency represents a process in computing and REST which a server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request where the returned result always remains the same. It is a security mechanism for retrying requests without the risk of performing the same operation more than once.</paragraph><paragraph>Such risks usually can occur when an API call is for some reason disrupted during processing (e.g. network connection error) and a response is not returned. In such cases the API call would be retried. By including an idempotencyKey in the initial request there is guarantee that the specific action won't be done more than once.</paragraph><paragraph>The idempotencyKey is generated only on the server-end in the use of Crypto APIs Callbacks. It is added to the Callback request and is unique per initial callback request. idempotencyKey values are generated randomly.</paragraph><paragraph>All original requests containing an idempotencyKey, along with their body and response status code (both success and error), are saved by the system. After that, any subsequent requests containing the same idempotencyKey will automatically return the same result.</paragraph><heading level="2">Setting up callbacks</heading><paragraph>Callbacks combine certain elements and steps needed to be able to create a correct reaction and on-time notification.</paragraph><paragraph>Their way of work includes the customer to first set up their callback subscription, and later on, whenever the subscription event occurs, for the Crypto APIs to notify the customer. All steps are taken through API Requests and Responses.</paragraph><list type="ol"><item>Customer sets up Callback URL The customer must first have a verified domain and set up Callback URL.</item><item>Customer subscribes for an event After verifying their domain, the customer has to send a request to Crypto APIs in order to subscribe for a callback on a certain event. The customer can subscribe to as many events they want, as many times as they need. When the customer sends their request to subscribe for an event the system must return a response. If there is no problem, where otherwise an error would result, the response from Crypto APIs would be "201 New resource successfully created". Then it is confirmed that the callback subscription for that particular event has been set up. If the subscription setup has failed, it will return an error, e.g. Error 409 Conflict. If an error is returned, there is a mistake or issue with the customer's request. It must be then fixed so that Crypto APIs can return a successful response.</item><item>Crypto APIs sends the Callback as a request Crypto APIs' responsibility to the customer is to notify them according to their subscription for that particular event or events only when it/they occur. Whenever the event happens Crypto APIs sends a request back to the customer that includes the data on the event, as requested by the customer. This is essentially the "callback" itself. If the callback is not confirmed by the customer side with a "200 OK" response, the system will follow a specific retry strategy.</item></list><paragraph>Customer sets up Callback URL</paragraph><paragraph>The customer must first have a verified domain and set up Callback URL.</paragraph><paragraph>Customer subscribes for an event</paragraph><paragraph>After verifying their domain, the customer has to send a request to Crypto APIs in order to subscribe for a callback on a certain event.

If the callback is not confirmed by the customer side with a "200 OK" response, the system will follow a specific retry strategy.</paragraph><paragraph>It is important to also clarify that subscribing for an event and setting a callback for it does not necessarily mean that the callback will occur soon or even at all. We do everything possible to make sure that callbacks have no delays, errors, or issues, and are received as the events occur.</paragraph><paragraph>Still, not receiving a callback for a subscribed event for a long time could be due to many reasons. There may be events that need to take days, weeks or months to occur even just once, and some that may encounter problems, errors, issues, and never happen at all.</paragraph><paragraph>A user will not receive a notification, an email, a message, a report or any other kind of alert for an event they have subscribed for, when the event has not occurred or will not happen at all, regardless of how much time has passed since the setup of the callback. Setting up a callback ensures the obligation of the system towards the customer to notify them only when the event happens.</paragraph><paragraph>Users might at times receive a notification for a callback event more than once, due to many Workers processing those. Make sure you use idempotency and you can also log processed events only once without processing such that are already-logged.</paragraph><heading level="3">Callback Retries</heading><paragraph>When the callback request is sent from Crypto APIs it expects a response from the customer side, as well.</paragraph><paragraph>Until a status code "200 OK Request has been successful" is received, Crypto APIs will keep retrying the request. There will be 5 retries in total distributed at certain intervals.</paragraph><list type="ul"><item>Crypto APIs will send the requested callback when it's time and a customer response is expected in the first 5 seconds; If a response isn't received during that time frame the system is prepared to send in total 5 retries of the callback; The first callback retry will be send after 5 min; After that, each following callback will take twice as long to be sent compared to the previous one. This is done with the purpose to extend the time during which the customer can at all receive the notification and its retries and provide opportunity for the customer to send a "200 OK" response; Additionally, there's an included "random value" into the algorithm as a factor of "0.2", which creates small but important fluctuations in the time frames between callback retries. This ensures that when large volumes of callbacks are sent they would not be in bulk due to having the same time frames, which could otherwise lead to crashes and server issues.</item></list><list type="ul"><item>If a response isn't received during that time frame the system is prepared to send in total 5 retries of the callback;</item><item>The first callback retry will be send after 5 min;</item><item>After that, each following callback will take twice as long to be sent compared to the previous one.

The system will mark all Blockchain Event subscriptions for the same event type, which have the same callback URL and same webhook ID, as "disabled".</paragraph><heading level="2">Callback Security</heading><paragraph>Crypto APIs has incorporated a security layer to keep callbacks from being intercepted, duplicated and make sure customers are receiving their callbacks only from Crypto APIs.</paragraph><heading level="3">Customer's Secret Key</heading><paragraph>The customer's request can include data on the event they want to subscribe for and has the option to also have a callbackSecretKey. This parameter is an optional security measure for the benefit of the customer. The callbackSecretKey can only be generated by the customer. It is used to create a unique hash string in the x-signature response header in the callback request sent from Crypto APIs when the event occurs.</paragraph><paragraph>The callbackSecretKey, and thus the x-signature, are set up per event subscription, not per single callback. Hence the customer only needs to set up the callbackSecretKey once when subscribing for an event. They can use a single callbackSecretKey for all subscriptions, or different ones for each subscription. The security is effective enough even with just one common callbackSecretKey.</paragraph><paragraph>Please note that though using the callbackSecretKey is an optional step, we recommend it for security purposes! Not using a callbackSecretKey means that no security layer will be applied to your callbacks.</paragraph><heading level="3">Callback Signature</heading><paragraph>In the case a customer has included a callbackSecretKey in their request to Crypto APIs, the callback (Crypto APIs' request to the customer) includes a specific x-signature value which is for verification purposes. It is used by the customer to verify the information they receive is in actuality really coming from Crypto APIs and not a scam.</paragraph><paragraph>The x-signature is provided in the header of the callback and represents a unique hash derived from all the information included in the callback about the event (which must be JSON encoded) and the customer's callbackSecretKey.</paragraph><paragraph>For the purpose HMAC_SHA256 is used. It stands for Hash-based message authentication code and along with its cryptographic hash function SHA256 it represents higher security than any other authentication code.</paragraph><paragraph>The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the size of the callbackSecretKey that has been used. The most common attack against HMACs is brute force to uncover that secret key. HMACs are substantially less affected by collisions than their underlying hashing algorithms alone.</paragraph><paragraph>When the customer receives the callback request from Crypto APIs, they can first check the x-signature before processing the request. By using their callbackSecretKey, which only they would know, together with the information from the callback they can generate a hash and compare it to the x-signature hash that the Crypto APIs server has returned. They must match which only then would authenticate Crypto APIs as the true sender.</paragraph><paragraph>After authentication of the callback, the customer can then proceed to processing it. If the authentication with the x-signature fails, then the customer must ignore it as someone else is sending it.</paragraph><paragraph>Example:</paragraph><paragraph>HMAC_SHA256 (callbackSecretKey, The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog) = f7bc83f430538424b13298e6aa6fb143ef4d59a14946175997479dbg2d1a3cd8</paragraph><paragraph>callbackSecretKey - Represents an optional string the customer can send into their request when they create the callback subscription. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog - Represents everything we post in the body of the server side callback request. f7bc83f430538424b13298e6aa6fb143ef4d59a14946175997479dbg2d1a3cd8 - Represents the resulting hash sent in the header (value name: x-signature) of the post request.</paragraph><heading level="2">Callback data returned for UTXO-based transactions</heading><paragraph>Calbacks return more specific information in regards to UTXO-based transactions (BTC). This specification applies to the following events:</paragraph><paragraph>For:</paragraph><list type="ul"><item>1 occurrence of the address in the input - in the callback we send the amount and the type is outgoing;</item><item>1 occurrence of address in output - in the callback we send the amount and the type is incoming;</item><item>2+ occurrences of address in inputs - in the callback we send the total calculated amount and the type is outgoing;</item><item>2+ occurrences of address in outputs - in the callback we send the total calculated amount and the type is incoming;</item><item>1 occurrence of address in input AND 1 occurrence of address in output - in the callback we send the amount in the input and the type is outgoing;</item><item>2+ occurrences of address in input AND 1 occurrence of address in output - in the callback we send the total calculated amount in the input and the type is outgoing;</item><item>1 occurrence of address in input AND 2+ occurrences of address in output - in the callback we send the amount in the input and the type is outgoing;</item><item>2+ occurrences of address in input AND 2+ occurrence of address in output - in the callback we send the total calculated amount in the input and the type is outgoing.</item></list></content>

Versions are generally titled with a date and "stable" versions are marked as such. You can try out new features and changes in our newer versions not marked as "stable". Our technical documentation lists all available API versions. To view a specific one, select it from the drop down menu.
